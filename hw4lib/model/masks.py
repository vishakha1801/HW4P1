TODO: Implement this function.

Specification:
- Function should create a padding mask that identifies padded positions in the input
- Mask should be a boolean tensor of shape (N, T) where:
  * N = batch size from padded_input
  * T = sequence length from padded_input
- True values indicate padding positions that should be masked
- False values indicate valid positions that should not be masked
- Padding is assumed to be on the right side of sequences
- Each sequence in the batch may have different valid lengths
- Mask should be on same device as input tensor

Specification:
- Function should create a causal mask for self-attention
- Mask should be a boolean tensor of shape (T, T) where T is sequence length
- True values indicate positions that should not attend to each other
- False values indicate positions that can attend to each other
- Causal means each position can only attend to itself and previous positions

- Mask should be upper triangular (excluding diagonal)
